The only thing the place had going for it was the location.”"},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"Thankfully, Turner was up for the challenge of transforming the structure into a home that was worthy of its setting. “I called the original house the Barbie Dreamhouse because it was quite vertical, with so many levels. But strangely enough, a sloped roof essentially cut off the view from half of the home,” he says. “I couldn’t fathom not opening up all the spaces to the ocean. I mean, why on earth would anyone want a house on the beach that didn’t come with an ocean view? We decided to let the light come in.”"},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"That decision meant a complete gut and remodel, which included removing the sloping roof—and the whole front of the house, as seen from the beach—to create an entirely new facade. Turner wanted a happy marriage between the home’s interiors and exteriors. “The client favors modern, so we were after a clean, contemporary look, but anyone who knows me knows I don’t do cold, minimalist modern,” says Turner. “I believe there’s a way to have a modern look that’s still warm and welcoming. I mean, we’re at the beach. It shouldn’t feel austere. It needed to feel relaxed and welcoming for the daytime and cozy and inviting for all the foggy, cool nights we get in California.”"},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"Once the house was opened to the view—including a wall of double-height windows in the great room that extends up to the kitchen and dining spaces above it—Turner went to work gathering the right ingredients for the interiors. Thankfully, his client wasn’t shy about using color, so he picked a palette of blue to mimic the variegated colors of the Pacific and carried the shades throughout the house. He infused natural textures—seagrass, wicker, rattan, and caning—for added warmth. And he carefully and methodically layered pattern to deliver personality."},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"“This is my clients’ vacation house, and I kept coming back to them and saying, ‘Look, vacation houses are meant to be fun.
