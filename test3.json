But when Hudson River School artists Thomas Cole and Frederic Church made their ways to the distant, wild idyll in the 1850s and returned with canvases of Mount Desert’s sweeps of stone, its romantic coves and wild seas, their exhibitions in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York created a sensation."},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"Victorians rushed aboard steamers and rail cars to discover Mount Desert for themselves but found the quiet spot not yet ready for prime time, tourism-wise. A smattering of small hotels barely covered the influx, so most vacationers took rooms with local farmers and fisher-men. And here’s the thing: Those adventuresome early tourists loved that rusticated life. They returned the next summer, and the summer after that, building friendships with their local hosts and seeding a culture of leisurely roughing it. They were termed rusticators—they clambered and picnicked on the rocky bluffs, fished and swam, climbed mountains, and enjoyed a simple, fresh existence that was a balm for their lives back home in the crowded, industrializing cities to the south."},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"But there were only so many huts and cottages to go around—by 1880, 30 hotels had popped up in the area. (The Claremont opened in 1884.) What artists and adventurers discover is generally gobbled up by the wealthy. And thus, the next wave to break upon Mount Desert Island was the newly minted American aristocracy of the late 19th century: scions like Frederick and George Vanderbilt, industrialists like Joseph Pulitzer and William Proctor, socialites like author Mary Cadwalader Jones and mining heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean. There were Rockefellers, Morgans, DuPonts, Bouviers, and Astors. Like their ilk who similarly decamped to Newport, Rhode Island, these Gilded Age glitterati built massive mansions along Frenchman Bay near the village of Bar Harbor as their summer “cottages.” Amid the splendor, textile heir and preservationist George Dorr began a strident campaign to purchase and preserve much of the eastern side’s landscape, ultimately leading to the creation of the national park in 1919 that would get its final name, Acadia, in 1929. And a sylvan Acadia it all was—an idealized playground of open lands, carriage roads, and even an official Millionaire Row in Bar Harbor. And then, in 1947, it all burned down."},{"//":"======== FULL BLEED CONTAINER ========","role":"container","layout":"fullBleedContainerLayout","components":[{"//":"======== IMAGE BLEED - H799.0/W1024.0 * 100 = 78.0273438 ========","role":"photo","layout":"fullBleedPhotoLayout","caption":{"format":"html","text":"Acadia National Park","textStyle":"captionEmbeddedTextStyle"},"URL":"https://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_889/storage/images/media2/images/p028-029-bzo102397-acadia-national-park/131456-1-eng-GB/p028-029-bzo102397-acadia-national-park.jpg?q=100"},{"role":"caption","layout":"captionLayout","textStyle":"captionTextStyle","format":"html","text":"Acadia National Park"}]},{"role":"body","layout":"bodyLayout","style":"paragraphStyle","textStyle":"bodyTextStyle","format":"html","text":"<lede>IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A MONTHLONG</lede> wildfire would terrorize this water-surrounded place, but that’s what happened.

But strong winds arrived on the 21st, whipping the flames into a conflagration that engulfed the eastern half of the island within days. While miraculously sparing Bar Harbor’s densely packed town center, flames consumed nearly all of Millionaire’s Row and swept through Acadia National Park, forming a fire ball over the sea before ultimately being declared fully extinguished on November 14. Most of the millionaires, by then beleaguered by the creation of the income tax several decades prior and the lingering vestiges of the Great Depression, never rebuilt and never returned. Nature, on the other hand, did—replacing spruce and fir with sun-loving birch and aspen. The result is today’s Mount Desert Island. On the western claw untouched by the fire, I find this grand historic hotel, quiet working towns like Southwest Harbor, lobster shacks, preserved coastlines, and bucolic small communities and fishing harbors.

A locus of maritime design and local employment, and a keyhole through which islanders peer into the lives of their richest neighbors, the company is a Maine—and MDI—institution. Dow’s day job is overseeing local Hinckleys, so he’s up close and personal with the million- and billionaires, from Rockefellers to Martha Stewart to <i>Law &amp; Order</i> impresario Dick Wolf.

Nearby, chef/owners Dave Allen and Zach Firestein at Hearth &amp; Harbor have performed their upgrade along culinary lines, putting wood-fired pizzas and local seafood at the center of their full-wall chalkboard menu. A few blocks away, Mary Musson’s whole family is hard at work in IslandBound Treats’ tiny-house bakeshop—rolling dough, filling, baking, and selling pies to a steady stream of folks pulling up in cars and sauntering by on the sidewalk. “We have to take one with us!” a patron gushes, rushing to get her hands on one of Musson’s last Triple Berry Pies of the day with, of course, Maine blueberries.

Down Route 102 from Southwest Harbor lies the ideal example: Thurston’s Lobster Pound in tiny Bernard, where I’m standing in line awaiting the noon opening so I can snag a seat overlooking Thurston’s docks, lobster pots stacked high, and the quiet marine hum of boats heading in and out of this protected little harbor. Christina Lapointe has not only helped keep the restaurant—in her family for five generations since great-grandfather Fred Thurston started the business in 1946—vibrantly humming, but also opened a new boutique, Slack Tide Shop, in a shingled house at the turn in the road to Thurston’s. Like Bramble &amp; Stone in Southwest Harbor, the curation here nods to tradition while updating the hunt-and-gather ethos with darling lobster-bedecked children’s wear, locally crafted soaps, and artisan sea salts. The pleasures in Bernard, now, are doubled thanks to Lapointe—from a bright-orange-red quarter-pound lobster on Thurston’s sunny dock to a spell of peak souvenir shopping.
